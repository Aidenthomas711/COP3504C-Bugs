Slide #10

Unless the user intends to put print("NOW name is " + " ".join(names) in the global space (also it is missing a
closing parentheses), the print statement should be tabbed so that it is contained within the main function. In 
addition, the original program would not run because the variable names would have not even been initialized yet
since the main() fuction has not been called.

Tab the code so that it is contained within the main() function and add a closing parenthesis.
