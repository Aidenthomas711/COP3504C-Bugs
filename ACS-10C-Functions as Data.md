# Slide Number: 11, 17

## Description
(Slide 11) On line 5 of the code, where "int(*ptr)(int, int) = Add;", Add should not have an uppercase A. It should have a lowercase A (a), or else it throws an error.
(Slide 12) The struct "Hero" wants to return the value age, but it is not defined.

## Possible Fix
(Slide 11) Change "Add" to "add" (like how it was originally declared).
(Slide 12) Declare age earlier in the struct.
